# Petsy: Commercial Pet Services Application

## Overview

"Petsy" is a commercial application designed to revolutionize pet care services by connecting pet owners with service providers. This project explores the feasibility of creating such an application by a single individual using modern technologies.
## Demonstration

This section showcases various stages and features of the Petsy application. The images provide a visual representation of the application's design, functionality, and user interface.

## Objectives and Scope

- **Primary Goal**: Develop a mobile application "Petsy".
- **Scope**: Document the entire application development process, leveraging the latest technologies.
- **Challenge**: Investigate the possibilities of creating the application single-handedly.

## Project Description

The project is inspired by the fact that 52% of Polish households own pets. Dubbed as "Uber for pets", Petsy aims to streamline services such as pet walking and sitting. Key features of the service include:

- Efficient search functionality.
- User reviews and feedback.
- Payment processing.
- Communication tools (e.g., chat).
- Effective order monitoring (e.g., photos/videos of pets).

Petsy will be available on Android, iOS, and Web platforms.

## Technology Stack

- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
- **Cross-platform Development with Xamarin**
- Other modern technologies tailored for robust application development.

## Project Structure

The dissertation covers:

1. **Existing Applications Study**: Research on similar apps (like Glovo, Uber), focusing on their architecture and technologies.
2. **Technology Overview**: Analysis and selection of programming languages, architectural patterns, protocols, etc.
3. **Application Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption, and security protocols.
4. **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**: System design using UML diagrams.
5. **Application Implementation**: Documentation with code snippets, diagrams, interface descriptions.
6. **Hardware and Configuration**: Service deployment, system administration, network setup, IP address procurement, SSL certificates.
7. **Conclusions**: System testing, application performance, and future development prospects.

## Conclusion

The project reflects a thorough research and practical approach towards developing a modern, service-oriented application for pet care services. The findings and implementation showcase the potential and challenges of developing such an application individually.
